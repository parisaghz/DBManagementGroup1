## Project Overview
In this project, we have chosen to explore the relationship between emotional tones in user and expert reviews and their influence on box office performance. Emotional responses can significantly shape audience interpretations of films, and our goal is to understand how these emotional dynamics correlate with a film's commercial success.

This study contributes to both theoretical and practical insights into box office determinants, helping to highlight the importance of emotional reception in shaping a filmâ€™s financial outcome.
